                                                            The increase in the number of research in the development of the Sciences and the advent of new technologies, as well as the consolidation of the connection between Science, Technology, and Society that occurred in the second half of the 20th century, alluded to the improvement of new computational technologies that were beginning to be used in various fields of knowledge, contributing to social changes, both collectively and individually. In this context, Bioinformatics emerged in the 1960s, a term used to refer to the combination of Computing, Technology, and Molecular Biology (HAGEN, 2000). The field aimed to break down barriers in the scientific areas through the development of new approaches that provided a new method for analyzing and identifying biological data (LESK, 2008).
                                                            OLATCG is a platform created with the aim of presenting some Bioinformatics tools and introducing simulations in Basic education, mainly in high school Biology classes.

It is a field that encompasses research, development, and the use of computer tools for understanding biological systems and processes. It is also an emerging area, as it uses Information Technology to distribute, organize, and analyze biological information. It is an attempt to simplify and solve complex biological problems by using computer systems and tools (PRATTA, 2018).

The project was initiated with the purpose of determining the entire sequence of genome bases: not only identifying all its genes but also storing the information in a reliable database that would provide public access. It also aimed to improve the way data analysis was conducted (FARAH, 2007). The HGP initiated a series of projects involving the sequencing of plants, mammals, invertebrates, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and more (VENTER, 2010).

                                                        Nowadays, many species have already had their genomes sequenced, and this number continues to grow. In this context, the field of Bioinformatics produces and explores a large volume of data, which is stored in databases such as the Nucleotide Sequence Database (EMBL-Bank) in the United Kingdom, the DNA Database of Japan (DDBJ), and GenBank of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (LESK, 2019).
                                                        GenBank stores information about nucleotide sequences from approximately 478,000 formally described species (SAYERS et al, 2021). In 1982, when the deposit of sequences in its databases began, GenBank had 606 nucleotide sequences and 680,338 bases. Today, it has over 2.1 billion deposited nucleotide sequences. Recent updates also include new resources for data related to the SARS-COV2 virus (SAYERS et al, 2021).
                                                        As Silva, Notari & Alba (2020, p.14) point out, "Processed biological data generate more biological data; the pace is frenetic." To ensure that these data are studied and contribute to advances in medical, biotechnological, and pharmaceutical research, Bioinformatics plays a significant role. It delineates itself as a field of knowledge directly related to the development of techniques that enhance the relationship between Computer Science and Biomedical areas. This has led to new applications of computational methods in biological problems and in silico experiments, making significant contributions to the study of disease prevention and treatment (CASANELLA SAINT-BLANCARD & RODRIGUEZ JORGE, 2015).
                                                        In recent days, there has been a gradual increase in information from academic discoveries in all three areas, especially in studies related to Genetics, Molecular Biology, and Biotechnology for the general public. This is largely due to recurring investments in scientific dissemination and mass media. Much of this information comes from Molecular Genetics, a field of Genetics and Molecular Biology that studies the structure, organization, and function of genes (FULTON, 2008; PIERCE, 2012).
                                                        Data generated by Bioinformatics enable detailed collection of information about the genetic code of living organisms, and currently, this is done extremely rapidly. For example, if we compare the time it took to analyze a sequence of about twelve thousand bases, which used to take about a year to decode, today it can be done in a minute. The possibilities for studying the genetic material of a living cell and its assistance in the interpretation of evolutionary processes have become fascinating (DE ARAUJO et al, 2008).
                                                        All these possibilities presented in the field of Bioinformatics pave the way for a better understanding of the population regarding the mechanisms of action and dissemination of disease-causing pathogens, for example. The popularization of information related to biological data in school activities, especially in the field of Genetics, helps the population gain basic knowledge in this area, aiding in the understanding of the molecular structure of DNA and the mechanisms involved in the transmission of hereditary traits.

Nesse contexto desponta, na década de 1960, a Bioinformática, termo utilizado para se referir à combinação entre Computação, Tecnologia e Biologia Molecular (HAGEN, 2000). O campo tinha como objetivo romper barreiras nas áreas científicas mediante o desenvolvimento de novas abordagens que proporcionassem um novo método de realizar análises e identificar dados biológicos (LESK, 2008).
                                                                        O OLATCG é uma plataforma criada com o intuito de apresentar algumas ferramentas de Bioinformática e introduzir simulações na educação Básica, principalmente no ensino de Biologia em turmas de ensino médio.`,

É uma área que engloba pesquisa, desenvolvimento e utilização de ferramentas de computador para o conhecimento de sistemas e processos biológicos, além de ser uma área emergente, pois faz uso da Tecnologia da Informação para distribuir, organizar e analisar informações biológicas. É uma tentativa de simplificar e resolver problemas biológicos complexos que lança mão de sistemas e ferramentas de computação (PRATTA, 2018).`,

O PGH deu início a uma série de projetos que envolviam o sequenciamento de plantas, mamíferos, invertebrados, fungos, bactérias, vírus, entre outros (VENTER, 2010).`,

Nesse sentido, a área da Bioinformática produz e explora um grande volume de dados, e para que esses dados sejam armazenados, utilizam-se bancos de dados, como por exemplo: Nucleotide Sequence Database (EMBL-Bank) no Reino Unido; o Banco de Dados de DNA do Japão (DDBJ), e GenBank do Centro Nacional de Informações sobre Biotecnologia (NCBI) (LESK, 2019).
                                                                        O GenBank armazena informação sobre sequências nucleotídicas de aproximadamente 478.000 espécies formalmente descritas (SAYERS et al, 2021). Em 1982, quando se iniciou o depósito de sequências em suas bases, o GenBank possuía 606 sequências nucleotídicas e 680.338 bases. Hoje já conta com mais de 2,1 bilhões de sequências de nucleotídeos depositadas. Atualizações recentes abarcam inclusive novos recursos para dados relacionados ao vírus SARS-COV2 (SAYERS et al, 2021).
                                                                        Como apontam Silva, Notari & Alba (2020, p.14) “Dados biológicos processados geram mais dados biológicos, o ritmo é frenético” e para que esses dados sejam estudados e proporcionem os avanços nas pesquisas médicas, biotecnológicas e farmacêuticas, a Bioinformática se faz presente. Sua demarcação acontece como um campo de saber diretamente relacionado ao desenvolvimento de técnicas que aprimorem a relação das Ciências da computação com as áreas Biomédicas; daí o surgimento de novas aplicações de métodos computacionais em problemas biológicos e em experimentações in sílico, contribuições efetivas para o estudo da prevenção e tratamento de doenças (CASANELLA SAINT-BLANCARD &  RODRIGUEZ JORGE, 2015).
                                                                        Nos dias atuais tem ocorrido um gradativo aumento de informações oriundas de descobertas científicas do meio acadêmico nas três áreas, em especial para estudos relacionados a Genética, Biologia Molecular e Biotecnologia para o público em geral. Muito se deve a investimentos recorrentes em divulgação científica e aos meios de comunicação de massa. Muitas dessas informações advêm da Genética Molecular, um campo da Genética e da Biologia Molecular que estuda a estrutura, organização e função dos genes (FULTON, 2008; PIERCE, 2012).
                                                                        Os dados gerados pela Bioinformática possibilitam a coleta detalhada de informações sobre o código genético dos seres vivos, sendo que, atualmente, isto se dá de maneira extremamente rápida. Se compararmos, por exemplo, o tempo para a análise de uma sequência contendo cerca de doze mil bases, o que demorava cerca de um ano para ser decodificado, hoje se dá em um minuto. Tornam-se fascinante as possibilidades de estudo do material genético de uma célula viva e sua consequente ajuda na interpretação, inclusive, dos processos evolutivos (DE ARAUJO et al, 2008).
                                                                        Todas essas possibilidades apresentadas no estudo da Bioinformática abrem caminho hoje para um maior entendimento da população com relação aos mecanismos de ação e disseminação de patógenos causadores de doenças, por exemplo. A popularização dessas informações relativas a dados Biológicos nas atividades escolares, principalmente na área da Genética, contribui para que a população tenha um conhecimento básico desta área, auxiliando a compreensão, desde a estrutura molecular do DNA até os mecanismos envolvidos na transmissão das características hereditárias.`,
